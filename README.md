# D603-Task-3-Time-Series-Modeling
### Overview


### SARIMA Time Series Forecasting â€“ Hospital Revenue Prediction
-	Built and tuned a SARIMA(1,1,2)(2,1,2,30) model to forecast daily hospital revenue based on 2 years of historical data.
-	Evaluated model assumptions (stationarity, autocorrelation) and diagnostics (Ljung-Box, Jarque-Bera tests); achieved RMSE of ~4.5 million.
-	Generated a 100-day forecast to support budgeting and resource planning, with annotated visualizations and uncertainty estimates.
